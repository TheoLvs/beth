Experimenting with Game AI applied to chess

## Idea
In this repo will be experiments around AI & chess. In particular Machine Learning applied to the chess game. <br>
The goal is to create: 

- Algorithms to play chess using Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning & NLP
- Auto-guide to help human learn and improve at playing chess
- Adaptive AI to match the player ELO and make him improve

> This repo is under active development


## Features
### Already developed
- Experimenting with the [python chess](https://python-chess.readthedocs.io/en) library
- Implementing ``Game`` framework
- ``HumanPlayer`` to play chess in Jupyter notebook
- ``RandomPlayer`` the most simple bot to easily test out new ideas and debug
### Roadmap
- AlphaGo approach: value function and policy function evaluation using Reinforcement Learning & MCTS
- AlphaZero approach: self play competition
- NLP approach: predicting next move using NLP techniques (LSTM, Transformers)
